# Voter-Registration-System
My task in Laravel Framework
I used it for email support from Mailtrap and below I have mentioned the credentials
Url 	 : https://mailtrap.io/
Username: charlesvictor.info@gmil.com
Password: Charles@25

Application Credentials
Url 	 : http://localhost/voter/login
Username: charlesvictor.info@gmil.com
Password: 12345678

FYI: Laravel Auth verification beginning it is working fine. But I installed some packages that time due to some causes errors. So please check my code validity also.
